# Daily Practice

This rpogram was written as a result of an after practice discussions.
This particular program uses a Validation Method

## Validation Method 

This is a method that is used to check for valid input from a user.
This helps to prevent a program from crashing if a user does not enter in 
valid information. Using a While() Loop, it akes in the information from a user 
and checks the result. If the information is valid, the program will continue. If
not, the program will notify the user of the error, ask for the info again,
and then try to validate that info. The validation method will end if the input is 
correct. The particular method I used was an Integer Validation Method that is "public"
and "static" so that it can be used anywhere in the program.
