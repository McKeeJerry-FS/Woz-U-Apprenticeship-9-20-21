# Woz-U Apprenticeship 9-20-21
 Theses are all programs completed for lessons during the Woz-U/Infosys Apprenticeship for 09/20/2021


This repo will come in handy for any of the programs that we have to write during this program

The one I will highlight here is HandOnPracticeProblem1. This program is at the end of lesson 5 and took 
Kanni and I a bit to figure out. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. For now I will be working on a 
Table of contents for this repo so that it will be easier to find the references for you to use.
